Getting Started
---------------

###  Using the compiled APK:

#### Get API Keys

You need to obtain an [openaikey](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and [azurekey](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/#features). Both services offer free tier plans.

#### Download and Install

Download and install the APK on your Android device from the [APK release](https://github.com/Gocyber-world/aivatar/releases) page. (MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE CAN ACCESS OPENAI AND AZURE)

#### Configure API Keys

Open the app and go to the settings page to enter your API keys and configure other settings.

#### Launch Avatar

Go back to the main screen, tap Miku (our default avatar), or create your own avatar in the "Add Character" section. Then tap the launch button!

### Compile from Source:

#### Install Unity

Download and install [Unity 2021.3.11f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

#### Install Android Studio and Upgrade Gradle

Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), then upgrade the Gradle Android Plugin to 7.5.

#### Clone the Repository

Clone the Aivatar GitHub repository.

#### Build the Project

#### Fix NDK Errors (if encountered)

```javascript
ndk.dir=C\:/Program Files/Unity/Hub/Editor/2021.3.11f1/Editor/Data/PlaybackEngines/AndroidPlayer/NDK
